                    <p>Hello there to anyone who happens to read this, name's Ryan and i'm the owner and proprietor of our little cozy chain of café's.</p>

                    <p>To talk a little about myself, i grew up in Brighton which is well known for having a thriving coffee scene, since i was young lad i always loved visiting these coffee shops after school i'd sit there for hours just reading and studying, so naturally as i grew up i dreamed of opening my little cozy corner of the world.</p>

                    <p>I followed my dreams and here we are, i've been quite thankful and have managed to open a few different café's all over the country, i hope that you enjoy our cozy corners of the world as much as we all do.</p>
